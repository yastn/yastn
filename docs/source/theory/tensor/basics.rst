Tensors
^^^^^^^

In general, tensors are multilinear maps from products of several vector spaces

.. math::

    T:\quad V^i\otimes V^j\otimes V^k\otimes...V_a\otimes V_b\otimes V_c\otimes... \rightarrow scalar,

where `T` expressed in basis and components is

.. math::
    T = \sum_{abc...ijk...} T^{abc...}_{ijk...} e^ie^je^k...e_ae_be_c...

YASTN refers to individual spaces :math:`V` as `legs`. In graphical notation
the shapes represent tensors, while legs correspond to lines emerging from these shapes

::

    (generic) tensor,    matrix,             vector
          ___
    V^i--|   |--V_a            ___                 _
    V^j--| T |--V_b      V^i--|_M_|--V_a     V^i--|W|
    V^k--|   |--V_c
      ...|___|...

.. note::
        YASTN defines a vector space and its abelian symmetry structure through :class:`yastn.Leg`

In some contexts, it is often useful to distinguish underlying spaces as co- or contra-variant
with respect to transformations acting on these spaces. Often such a distinction is encoded
through position of the indices - subscript or superscript.

In quantum mechanics, it is useful to distinguish between :math:`\langle bra |`
and :math:`|ket \rangle` spaces, due to different action of symmetry transformations on these spaces

.. math::

    T = \sum_{abc...ijk...} T^{abc...}_{ijk...} |i \rangle|j \rangle|k \rangle ...
    \langle a |\langle b |\langle c |...

In YASTN, similar to other implementations (:ref:`see below <refs_basics>`), the distinction between
:math:`\langle bra |` and :math:`|ket \rangle` spaces, or Hilbert space :math:`\mathcal{H}` and its dual :math:`\mathcal{H}^*`, is encoded through `signature`.

.. note::
    `signature`, :attr:`yastn.Tensor.s`, is a tuple of signs :math:`\pm 1`

Action of abelian symmetry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For any element `g` of abelian group G, its action on tensor elements :math:`T^{ab...}_{ij...}`
in a proper basis can be represented by `diagonal` matrices `U(g)` acting on each of the vector spaces

.. math::

    (gT)^{ab...}_{ij...} = \sum_{a'b'...i'j'...} T^{a'b'...}_{i'j'...} [U(g)^*]^{a}_{a'} [U(g)^*]^{b}_{b'} ... {U(g)}^{i'}_{i} {U(g)}^{j'}_{j}...,

where the elements of `U(g)` are complex phases defined by **charges** :math:`t_i`,
in YASTN always taken to be integers :math:`\mathbb{Z}` or their subset, as

.. math::

    U(g)^j_k=exp(-i\theta_g t_j)\delta_{jk}

with angle :math:`\theta_g \in [0,2\pi)`, which depends on :math:`g \in G`, and :math:`\delta_{jk}` being
Kronecker delta.

This structure gives a simple selection rule that all symmetric tensors must obey.
Taking group element :math:`g \in G` for **all non-zero** elements of `T`, it must hold

.. math::

    (gT)^{ab...}_{ij...} = T^{ab...}_{ij...}exp[i\theta_g(t_a+t_b+...-t_i-t_j-...)].

.. _symmetry selection rule:

The selection rule can be equivalently expressed as charge conservation

.. math::
    t_a+t_b+...-t_i-t_j-... = N

with total charge of the tensor `N` being independent of tensor elements :math:`T^{ab...}_{ij...}`. In the case of :math:`N=0` such tensor is invariant (unchanged) under the action of the symmetry.
Otherwise, it transforms covariantly as all its elements are altered by the same complex phase :math:`exp(i\theta_gN)`.

The charges :math:`t_i,\ N` and precise form of their addition :math:`+` depends on the abelian group
considered.

.. note::
    * Total charge `N` of YASTN tensor can be accessed by :attr:`yastn.Tensor.n`
    * To inspect what charge sectors :math:`t_i` exist on legs of a tensor
      use :meth:`yastn.Tensor.get_legs`.


Examples for selected groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **U(1)**: The charges can be taken as integers :math:`t_i \in \mathbb{Z}` with usual integer addition.
  With :math:`\theta_g` being usual angle :math:`\theta_g \in [0,2\pi)`.
* **Z(2)**: The charges are just a subset of integers :math:`t_i \in \{0,1\}` with addition :math:`\textrm{mod 2}`. Similarly, two elements of group Z(2) are mapped to angles :math:`\{0,1\}\xrightarrow{\theta} \{0,\pi\}`.
* direct product :math:`\mathbf{Z_2xU(1)}`: The charges of individual groups are accummulated in a vector :math:`t_i \in \{0,1\}\otimes \mathbb{Z}`. The addition is distributed

.. math::

    t_i+t'_i := \begin{pmatrix} t_{i,0} \\ t_{i,1} \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} t'_{i,0} \\ t'_{i,1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} t_{i,0} + t'_{i,0}\ \textrm{mod}\ 2\\ t'_{i,1} + t'_{i,1} \end{pmatrix}

.. note::
    See how YASTN defines symmetries and the above examples in the :ref:`API docs<tensor/symmetry:specifying symmetry>`.

Conjugation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Conjugation of a tensor complex-conjugates tensor elements, flips tensor signature :attr:`yastn.Tensor.s` by
replacing :math:`\pm 1 \to \mp 1`, as well as the total charge :math:`N \to -N`.
In the latter, :math:`-` depends on the abelian group.

It is also possible to flip the signature of a specific leg, which is accompanied by negation of charges on that leg.

.. note::
    See :ref:`API docs<tensor/algebra:Conjugation of symmetric tensors>`, for various types of conjugation.
