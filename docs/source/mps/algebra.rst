Multiplication by a scalar
---------------------------

MPS/MPO can be multiplied by a scalar using regular `*` operator, e.g., :code:`B = a * A` or :code:`B = A * a`.

Addition of MPS/MPO
-------------------

Two MPS's or two MPO's can be added up, provided that their length, physical dimensions, and symmetry agree.
The sum of two such objects :code:`A` and :code:`B` results in new MPS/MPO :code:`C = A + B`, with tensor of :code:`C` given by the direct sum of :code:`A`'s
and :code:`B`'s tensors along virtual dimension.

    .. autofunction:: yamps.MpsMpo.__add__

To make a sum of many MPS/MPOs :math:`\{A_0, A_1,\dots\}` at once, use :code:`yamps.add(A_0, A_1,...)`.

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.mps.add

Following example show an addition of two MPSs:

Products of MPO and MPS
-----------------------

API supports *product* ``@`` of

i) MPO with MPS resulting in a new MPS in analogy with
:math:`\hat{O}|\psi\rangle = |\phi\rangle` (i.e. matrix-vector multiplication).

::

 # a product of MPO O and MPS A

              ___        ___         ___
             |___|--D'--|___|--...--|___|      ___        ___         ___
 C = O @ A =  _|_        _|_         _|_   =  |___|-DxD'-|___|--...--|___|
             |___|--D --|___|--...--|___|       |          |           |
               |          |           |

ii) two MPOs resulting in a new MPO corresponding to usual
operator product :math:`\hat{O}\hat{P} = \hat{C}` (matrix-matrix multiplication).

::

 # a product of two MPO's O and P

              _|d_       _|_         _|_
             |___|--D---|___|--...--|___|    _|d          _|_         _|_
 C = O @ P =  _|_        _|_         _|_  = |___|--DxD'--|___|--...--|___|
             |___|--D'--|___|--...--|___|     |d           |           |
               |d         |           |

One can either use product operator :code:`C = A @ B` or more verbose
:code:`C = yastn.tn.mps.multiply(A, B)`. See examples here: :ref:`examples/mps/algebra:Multiplication`.

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.mps.multiply


Multiplication with truncation
------------------------------

A fast procedure to multiply MPO by MPO/MPS while performing truncation.
The result can be subsequently fine-funed using :ref:`mps/algorithms_overlap:Variational overlap maximalization algorithm`.

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.mps.zipper
