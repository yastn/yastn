Creating PEPS
=============

Initializing empty PEPS
-----------------------

PEPS is an instance of a class :class:`yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps`, utilizing a lattice geometry setup
(e.g., SquareLattice or CheckerboardLattice). Each unique lattice site is associated with a tensor,
following the layout specified by the lattice geometry.

::

      # leg ordering of PEPS tensors is
      # top, left, bottom, right, physical

                  top `0th`
                     ╲
                      ╲
                  ┌────┴────┐
    left `1st` ───┤ A_{x,y} ├─── right `3rd`
                  └──┬────┬─┘
                     |     ╲
                     |      ╲
                phys `4th`  bottom `2nd`

.. autoclass:: yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps
    :members: copy, clone, shallow_copy, save_to_dict, transfer_mpo


Initializing product PEPS
-------------------------

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.fpeps.product_peps

See examples at :ref:`quickstart/kibble_zurek:Kibble-Zurek quench in 2D transverse-field Ising model`.


Import and export PEPS
----------------------

PEPS instances can be saved as Python dict after serialization by
:meth:`yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps.save_to_dict`. This enables saving the PEPS structure,
lattice geometry, and tensor data for storage or transfer. A PEPS object can later be
deserialized back using :meth:`yastn.tn.fpeps.load_from_dict`.

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.fpeps.load_from_dict

Finite (small) PEPS can be contracted into a tensor.

.. automethod:: yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps.to_tensor


Double-layer PEPS
-----------------

Calculation of expectation values of interests requires contraction of PEPS with its conjugate.
This amounts to the contraction of the PEPS network composed of reduced rank-4 tensors :math:`a`, which is
obtained by tracing over the physical index in tensors :math:`A` and it's conjugate :math:`A^{\dagger}`.
It is supported by a special class :class:`yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps2Layers`, that outputs tensor :math:`a`
in the form of :class:`yastn.tn.fpeps.DoublePepsTensor` while accessed with :code:`[]` for a given site.

.. autoclass:: yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps2Layers


Double PEPS Tensor
------------------

The auxiliary class allows treating top and bottom PEPS tensors---to be contracted along
physical dimensions---as a single tensor of rank-4 for various operations.
It provides a dispatching mechanism for efficient contraction in construction of enlarge corners in CTMRG or boundary MPS algorithms.

Note that in the following diagram the virtual legs of the peps tensor are labelled by
:math:`t` (top), :math:`l` (left), :math:`b` (bottom), and :math:`r` (right) in an anticlockwise fashion.
For the conjugate tensor, similarly, they are labelled by :math:`{t'}`, :math:`{l'}`, :math:`{b'}` and :math:`{r'}`.
Swap gates are placed where the legs cross. This gives a simple structure for the contracted tensors on
the :math:`2D` lattice, respecting the global fermionic order.
