    r"""
    Perform CTMRG sweeps until convergence, starting from PEPS and environmental corner and edge tensors :code:`peps`.

    The outer loop sweeps over PEPS updating only the environmental tensors through 2x2 windows of PEPS tensors.
    Convergence can be controlled based on observables or Schmidt values of projectors.
    The CTMRG algorithm sweeps through the lattice at most :code:`max_sweeps` times
    or through some externally set convergence criteria.

    Outputs iterator if :code:`iterator_step` is given.
    It allows inspecting :code:`CtmEnv` outside of :code:`ctmrg_` function after every :code:`iterator_step` sweeps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peps: yastn.fPEPS.Lattice
        peps tensors occupying all the lattice sites in 2D. Maybe obtained after real or imaginary time evolution.
        It is not updated during execution.

    env: yastn.fPEPS.CtmEnv
        Initial environmental tensors: maybe random or given by the user. It is updated during execution.
        The virtual bonds aligning with the boundary can be of maximum bond dimension chi

    chi: maximal CTM bond dimension

    cutoff: controls removal of singular values smaller than cutoff during CTM projector construction

    prec: stop execution when 2 consecutive iterations give difference of a function used to evaluate conv smaller than prec

    max_sweeps: int
        Maximal number of sweeps.

    iterator_step: int
        If int, :code:`ctmrg_` returns a generator that would yield output after every iterator_step sweeps.
        Default is None, in which case  :code:`ctmrg_` sweeps are performed immediately.

    tcinit: symmetry sectors of initial corners legs

    Dcinit: dimensions of initial corner legs

    AAb = 0 (no double-peps tensors; 1 = double peps tensors with identity; 2 = for all

    Returns
    -------
    out: CTMRGout(NamedTuple)
        Includes fields:
        :code:`sweeps` number of performed dmrg sweeps.
        :code:`env` environmental tensors.
        :code:`proj` projectors.
