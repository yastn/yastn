    r"""
    Perform variational optimization sweeps until convergence to best approximate the target, starting from MPS/MPO :code:`psi`.

    The outer loop sweeps over ``psi`` updating sites from the first site to the last and back.
    Convergence can be controlled based on overlap and/or Schmidt values (which is a more sensitive measure of convergence).
    The algorithm performs at most :code:`max_sweeps`. If tolerance measures are provided,
    the calculation ends when the convergence criteria are satisfied, e.g., change in overlap or Schmidt values between sweeps
    is less than the provided tolerance.

    Works for

        * optimization against provided MPS: ``target`` is ``MPS`` or list ``[MPS]``
        * against MPO acting on MPS: ``target`` is a list ``[MPO, MPS]``.
        * against sum of MPOs acting on MPS: ``target`` is a list ``[[MPO, MPO, ...], MPS]``.
        * sum of any of the three above: target is ``[[MPS], [MPO, MPS], [[MPO, MPO, ...], MPS], ...]``
        * for ``psi`` being itself an MPO, all MPS's above should be replaced with MPO, e.g., ``[MPO, MPO]``

    Outputs iterator if :code:`iterator_step` is given, which allows
    inspecting :code:`psi` outside of :code:`compression_` function after every :code:`iterator_step` sweeps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psi: yastn.tn.mps.MpsMpoOBC
        Initial state. It is updated during execution.
        It is first canonized to the first site, if not provided in such a form.
        State resulting from :code:`compression_` is canonized to the first site.

    target: MPS or MPO
        Defines target state. The target can be:

        * an MPS, e.g. target = MPS or [MPS],
        * an MPO acting on MPS (target = [MPO, MPS]),
        * sum of MPOs acting on MPS, e.g, [[MPO, MPO], MPS],
        * or the sum of the above, e.g., [[MPS], [MPO, MPS], [[MPO, MPO], MPS]].
        * If ``psi`` and ``target`` are MPOs, the MPS in above list is replaced by MPO.

    method: str
        Which optimization variant to use from `'1site'`, `'2site'`

    overlap_tol: float
        Convergence tolerance for the change of relative overlap in a single sweep.
        By default is `None`, in which case overlap convergence is not checked.

    Schmidt_tol: float
        Convergence tolerance for the change of Schmidt values on the worst cut/bond in a single sweep.
        By default is `None`, in which case Schmidt values convergence is not checked.

    max_sweeps: int
        Maximal number of sweeps.

    iterator_step: int
        If int, :code:`compression_` returns a generator that would yield output after every iterator_step sweeps.
        The default is None, in which case  :code:`compression_` sweeps are performed immediately.

    opts_svd: dict
        Options passed to :meth:`yastn.linalg.svd` used to truncate virtual spaces in :code:`method='2site'`.

    Returns
    -------
    compression_out(NamedTuple)
        NamedTuple with fields

            * :code:`sweeps` number of performed sweeps.
            * :code:`overlap` overlap after the last sweep.
            * :code:`doverlap` absolute value of relative overlap change in the last sweep.
            * :code:`max_dSchmidt` norm of Schmidt values change on the worst cut in the last sweep.
            * :code:`max_discarded_weight` norm of discarded_weights on the worst cut in '2site' procedure.

    The outer loop sweeps over MPS :code:`psi` updating sites from the first site to the last and back.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psi: yastn.tn.mps.MpsMpoOBC
