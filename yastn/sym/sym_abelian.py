        Fusion rule for abelian symmetry.

        An `i`-th row ``charges[i,:,:]`` contains `m` length-`NSYM`
        charge vectors, where `m` is the number of legs being fused.
        For each row, the charge vectors are added up (fused) with selected ``signatures``
        according to the group addition rules.

        Parameters
        ----------
        charges: np.ndarray[int]
            :math:`k \times m \times nsym` matrix, where :math:`k` is the number of
            independent blocks, and :math:`m` is the number of fused legs.

        signatures: np.ndarray[int]
            integer vector with :math:`m` elements in :math:`{-1, +1}`.

        new_signature: int
            new signature for a new leg from fused legs.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray[int]
            matrix of integers with shape (k, NSYM) of fused charges;
            includes multiplication by ``new_signature``.

        Auxiliary function for adding tensor charges.
        It employs :meth:`fuse` function and returns resulting charge as a tuple of integers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        charges: Sequence[tuple[int, ...]]
            Sequence of charges to be added.

        signatures: None | Sequence[int]
            Signature for provided charges.
            The default None uses signature 1 for all charges.

        new_signature: int
            Signature for the addition result. The default is 1.
